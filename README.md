Managing your to-do list has never been easier. TaskMate allows you to quickly assess and allocate time to each task, providing a clear overview of your priorities.
## key features:
* Effortless Task Planning: Plan and organize your tasks with ease using the intuitive drag-and-drop calendar.
* Visual Time Allocation: Easily visualize the time needed for each task, ensuring efficient and effective planning.
* Multiple Calendars: Create and manage multiple calendars for different purposes, allowing you to keep work, personal, and other aspects of your life organized separately.


NOTE: This is a WIP Project. Although core functionality has been implemented, there are some bugs to be worked out and additional features which will be developed soon. These include:
* ensuring consistency between the database in UTC and the user's local time zone
* customization of Task properties by Calendar, and colour-coding of Tasks by property
* allow sharing of Calendars between users
* optimizing requests to API
